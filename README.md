## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

We will be using Python, SQL Alchemy and a sqlite file for this analysis. You can find the dataset (hawaii.sqlite) in the [Resources](https://github.com/Corters22/sqlalchemy-challange/tree/main/Resources) directory and the code Climate Analysis and Exploration.ipynb in the [Analysis](https://github.com/Corters22/sqlalchemy-challange/tree/main/Analysis) directory.

### Precipitation Analysis

We start this analysis with figuring out the most recent date of our data. From here we are able to see the precipiation levels for the final 12 months of the data. These numbers are represented below with a bar chart.

With the precipitation data, we also performed a summary statistical description.
